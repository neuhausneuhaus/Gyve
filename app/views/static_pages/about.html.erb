        <h1>Gyve aims to link donors with people experiencing homelessness to help provide an overlooked and underfunded need: <b>transportation</b>.</h1>
        <p> Lack of a metro card can be an insurmountable barrier to individuals looking to access food, health care and job programs. </p>
        <p>

          We work with case workers who present you, the donor, with their clients who need a MetroCard in order to access social services. You can donate a whole montly card or join our community of givers and contribute to part of a montly card. 
          <a href="/signup">Click here to join</a>

          <br><br><br>
          Are you a case worker? Let us know who your clients are and where they're trying to go and our community will join forces and funds to provide them with a monthly MetroCard.
